Hi, I'm Nicola :wave:

I currently study Automation engineering at Politecnico in Milan :robot:

My passion for robotics and coding brought me to take part in competitions like [RoboCup JR](http://www.robocupjunior.it/), [OIS](https://sites.google.com/aldini.istruzioneer.it/olimpiadi-informatica-squadre/homepage), [CyberChallenge](https://cyberchallenge.it/)

My main experience in the development of a long term project is the design and construction of a line-follower robot for RoboCup JR ([RL2019-20](https://github.com/Ettore-Tancredi/RL2019-20)) in collaboration con [@Ettore-Tancredi](https://github.com/Ettore-Tancredi) members 

In the future I hope to contribute to open source projects :smiley:
