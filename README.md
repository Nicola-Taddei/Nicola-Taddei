#### Hi, I'm Nicola :wave:

I currently study Automation engineering at Politecnico in Milan :robot:

My passion for robotics and coding brought me to take part in competitions like [RoboCup JR](https://junior.robocup.org/), [OIS](https://sites.google.com/aldini.istruzioneer.it/olimpiadi-informatica-squadre/homepage), [CyberChallenge](https://cyberchallenge.it/).

My main experience in the development of a long term project is the design and construction of a line-follower robot for RoboCup JR ([Rescue Line](https://github.com/orgs/Ettore-Tancredi/projects)) in collaboration con [@Ettore-Tancredi](https://github.com/orgs/Ettore-Tancredi) members.

I'm currently collaborating with [@luigi-massacci](https://github.com/luigi-massacci) in writing a guide to the RoboCup JR-Line Follower competition with open source software and tips for the design and realization of the robot itself.

In the future I hope to contribute to more open source projects :smiley:
