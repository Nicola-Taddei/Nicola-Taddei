#### Hi, I'm Nicola :wave:

I currently study Robotics, Systems and Control at ETH Zurich :robot:

My passion for robotics and coding brought me to take part in competitions like [AI-DO](https://duckietown.com/research/ai-driving-olympics/), [RoboCup JR](https://junior.robocup.org/), [OIS](https://sites.google.com/aldini.istruzioneer.it/olimpiadi-informatica-squadre/homepage), [CyberChallenge](https://cyberchallenge.it/)

My main academic interests are Control Theory and Reinforcement Learning. 

I am currrently engaged in a university project within the field of promptable robots ([OpenRobotGPT](https://github.com/Nicola-Taddei/OpenRobotGPT)). Our goal is to construct an open-source platform serving as a foundational framework for researchers utilizing a code-as-policy approach to rapidly test their ideas. If you are interested in collaborating on the project, please don't hesitate to contact me. ðŸ˜ƒ
